movement using the camera as a reference point.
speed can be a value from `0` to `1`.

##### Params

- **speed** - The speed for which to return data

##### Returns

`nil`

## disableEmergency() 

Causes the emergency REF bit to be set to 1 until 
`navdata.droneState.emergencyLanding` is `0.` This recovers a drone that has 
flipped over and is showing red lights to be flyable again and show green 
lights. It is also done implicitly when creating a new high level client.
